Adjustment Calculator
======================

Description:

This is a simple calculator for making additions to paint systems at my job. I wanted to build this to get a simple project up and running, and hosted live at my domain site.


How it works:

It simply gets the tank and lines level from the user, does some calculations in the background, and tells the user the appropriate result.


Technologies:

This was created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with an assist from some Bootstrap styling. Plus my dog Kevin.
